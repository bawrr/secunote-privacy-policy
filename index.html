  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: October 2025</em></p>

  <p><strong>SecuNote</strong>, developed by <strong>Ben Ralph</strong>, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how the app collects, uses, and stores data when you use it.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>SecuNote is designed to provide a secure and private environment for users to create and manage notes. Some features may allow users to attach images using the device’s camera. All data captured through the app is stored locally on the user’s device. The app does not transmit, share, or analyze any personal data or media.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>SecuNote <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information</strong> to external servers or third parties. However, certain permissions may be requested by your operating system to allow the app to function properly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera access:</strong> Used solely to capture photos that the user chooses to attach to notes. Photos are saved locally on your device. SecuNote does not upload, analyze, or share these photos.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage access (if applicable):</strong> Used only to save and retrieve your notes and attached images within your device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No analytics, tracking, or background data collection is performed by SecuNote.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All notes, photos, and files are stored locally on your device’s internal storage or app data directory.</li>
    <li>The app does not use any cloud storage or online backup.</li>
    <li>If you choose to export or share your data, it is done manually by you through standard Android sharing mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>SecuNote does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services that process or collect user data. There are <strong>no analytics SDKs, advertising services, or external APIs</strong> in the app.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>SecuNote is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us for assistance.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>While SecuNote stores all information locally, users are responsible for maintaining the physical security of their devices. We recommend enabling device-level security features (such as screen locks or encryption) to protect your data.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since SecuNote does not collect or store personal data externally, users retain full control of their information at all times. If you uninstall the app, all associated data stored locally on your device will be permanently deleted.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of SecuNote after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

  <hr>
